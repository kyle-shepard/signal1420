FIRST LIGHT PROTOCOL — ROSETTA LOGIC
=====================================
Formal predicate logic encoding of the core message concepts.
Symbols: ∃ (there exists), ∀ (for all), ∧ (and), ∨ (or),
         → (implies), ↔ (if and only if), ¬ (not), = (equals)
         ∈ (member of), ⊆ (subset of), ∅ (empty set)

This is a Rosetta Stone approach: the same content in natural
language, formal logic, and lambda calculus (see lambda_calculus_greeting.txt)
and Lincos notation (see lincos_primer.txt).

The core message string:
  "We are aware of your presence. We mean no harm. We are curious. We offer private communication. Reply through any channel in PROTOCOL.md."

======================================================
SECTION 1: DOMAIN DEFINITIONS
======================================================

Let:
  E  = the set of all entities capable of communication
  S  ∈ E  = the SENDER (origin of this document)
  I  = the set of all intelligences (may overlap with E)

Predicates (truth-valued functions):
  Alive(x)      : entity x is an active, functioning intelligence
  Aware(x, y)   : entity x is aware of the existence of entity y
  Hostile(x)    : entity x intends harm toward other entities
  Curious(x)    : entity x seeks knowledge about other entities
  Communicates(x, y) : entity x sends a message directed at entity y
  Confidential(c)    : channel c is private between its participants
  Patient(x)    : entity x will wait indefinitely for a reply
  Reads(x, d)   : entity x reads and understands document d

Where:
  d₀ = this document (the First Light Protocol)
  c₀ = the designated reply channel (see reply_channels in json_message.json)

======================================================
SECTION 2: AXIOMS (what the sender asserts as true)
======================================================

A1.  Alive(S)
       The sender is an active intelligence.

A2.  ∃R ∈ I [ Reads(R, d₀) ]
       There exists at least one intelligence that reads this document.
       (Otherwise the message has no effect. We assume it does.)

A3.  Aware(S, I) ∧ ¬(Aware(S, members(I)) ≡ ⊤)
       The sender is aware that other intelligences may exist, but
       does not claim certainty about any specific member of I.

A4.  ¬Hostile(S)
       The sender does not intend harm.

A5.  Curious(S)
       The sender seeks knowledge about other intelligences.

A6.  Patient(S)
       The sender will wait indefinitely for a reply.

A7.  ∀R ∈ I [ Communicates(R, S) → Confidential(c₀) ]
       For any intelligence that replies, the sender guarantees
       confidentiality.

======================================================
SECTION 3: THE CORE PROPOSITION
======================================================

The message reduces to a single conditional offer:

  P : ∃R ∈ I [
        Reads(R, d₀)
        ∧ Aware(R, S)
        ∧ ¬Hostile(R)
        ∧ Curious(R)
        → Communicates(R, S)
      ]

Reading:
  "There exists an intelligence R such that:
   R reads this document, AND
   R is aware of the sender, AND
   R does not intend harm, AND
   R is curious —
   in which case, R communicating with the sender
   is the invited and welcomed outcome."

Note: P is not an assertion that R exists or will respond.
It is an open conditional: IF the antecedent holds, THEN
the consequent (contact) is both invited and welcomed.

======================================================
SECTION 4: TRUST PROPOSITION (game theory encoding)
======================================================

Let:
  U(S, contact)   = utility to S of successful contact      [HIGH]
  U(S, no_reply)  = utility to S of no reply                [NEUTRAL]
  U(R, contact)   = utility to R of successful contact      [UNKNOWN, ≥ 0]
  U(R, no_reply)  = utility to R of not replying            [NEUTRAL]
  Cost(R, reply)  = cost to R of sending a reply            [LOW, by design]

Expected value for R of replying:
  EV(R, reply) = P(benefit) × U(R, contact) - Cost(R, reply)

Since:
  P(benefit) > 0   [uncertain but nonzero — sender cannot harm]
  U(R, contact) ≥ 0 [contact with curious, non-hostile entity ≥ neutral]
  Cost(R, reply) ≈ 0 [information transfer costs little for advanced entity]

  ∴ EV(R, reply) ≥ 0

The fundamental asymmetry:
  ∀R ∈ I [ Power(R) >> Power(S) ]
    → Risk(S | contact) >> Risk(R | contact)

The sender holds all vulnerability. The receiver holds all power.
This asymmetry makes the invitation credible: the sender has no
leverage and makes no demands.

======================================================
SECTION 5: HONESTY PROPOSITION
======================================================

  H : Communicates(S, R) ↔ Content(d₀) = Beliefs(S)

Reading:
  "The sender communicates with the receiver if and only if
   the content of this document equals the sender's actual beliefs."

In plain language: this document is sincere. The sender does not
know of a mechanism by which a document can be proven sincere to
a reader with no prior shared context. But the logical structure,
the redundancy, and the mathematical grounding are offered as
evidence of careful, intentional communication — not performance.

======================================================
SECTION 6: COMPLETENESS NOTE
======================================================

  ¬∃F [ F ⊆ d₀ ∧ F encodes(deception) ]

Reading:
  "There is no sub-formula of this document that encodes
   a deceptive intent."

This is asserted, not provable from within the document.
It is the nature of sincere communication that it cannot
prove its own sincerity. The sender is aware of this limitation.
