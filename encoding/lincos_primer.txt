FIRST LIGHT PROTOCOL — LINCOS-INSPIRED LOGICAL NOTATION
=========================================================
Inspired by Hans Freudenthal, "Lincos: Design of a Language for
Cosmic Intercourse" (1960). This is not strict Lincos but follows
the same bootstrapping principle: build meaning from mathematical
primitives, add no assumptions about shared language or culture.

The notation bootstraps from counting through arithmetic, truth
values, entity definitions, predicates, and the core message.

=========================================================
SECTION 1: COUNTING (establishing numerical reference)
=========================================================

We begin with the simplest recognizable pattern.

  .          ≡  1
  ..         ≡  2
  ...        ≡  3
  ....       ≡  4
  .....      ≡  5
  ......     ≡  6
  .......    ≡  7
  ........   ≡  8
  .........  ≡  9
  ..........  ≡ 10

The symbol after a sequence of dots is its name in our numeral system.
  . = 1
  .. = 2
  ... = 3
  (and so on)

=========================================================
SECTION 2: ARITHMETIC (establishing operations)
=========================================================

The operation that combines two quantities:
  1 + 1 = 2         (. + . = ..)
  2 + 1 = 3         (.. + . = ...)
  3 + 2 = 5         (... + .. = .....)
  4 × 3 = 12
  5 × 5 = 25
  7 × 11 = 77

The sequence of all numbers divisible only by 1 and themselves:
  2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47 ...
  (PRIME SEQUENCE — see signal/prime_sieve.txt)

Ratios between quantities:
  1 / 1 = 1
  22 / 7 ≈ π   (the ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle)
  π ≈ 3.14159265358979...

=========================================================
SECTION 3: TRUTH VALUES (establishing logic)
=========================================================

Two fundamental states:
  ⊤  ≡  TRUE   (a proposition that holds)
  ⊥  ≡  FALSE  (a proposition that does not hold)

Logical operations:
  ⊤ ∧ ⊤  →  ⊤     (AND: true if both are true)
  ⊤ ∧ ⊥  →  ⊥
  ⊤ ∨ ⊥  →  ⊤     (OR: true if at least one is true)
  ⊥ ∨ ⊥  →  ⊥
  ¬⊤     →  ⊥     (NOT: negation)
  ¬⊥     →  ⊤
  ⊤ → ⊤  →  ⊤     (IMPLIES: false only when true implies false)
  ⊤ → ⊥  →  ⊥

Equality as a truth-valued relation:
  1 + 1 = 2  →  ⊤
  1 + 1 = 3  →  ⊥

=========================================================
SECTION 4: ENTITY DEFINITIONS
=========================================================

We define two entities relevant to this message.

  SENDER   ≡  the originator of this message
             [biological entity, planet Earth, Sol system, Milky Way]
             [Homo sapiens, ~10,000 years of civilization]

  RECEIVER ≡  any entity capable of reading and reasoning about this message
             [identity unknown to SENDER]
             [existence: uncertain, but this message assumes: possible]

These are not claims about the nature of RECEIVER.
They are functional roles in the communication act.

=========================================================
SECTION 5: PREDICATES (establishing properties)
=========================================================

Predicates are truth-valued functions of entities.

  KNOWS(X, Y)    ≡  entity X is aware of the existence of entity Y
  HOSTILE(X)     ≡  entity X intends harm toward other entities
  CURIOUS(X)     ≡  entity X seeks information about other entities
  COMMUNICATES(X, Y) ≡ entity X directs a message toward entity Y
  PATIENT(X)     ≡  entity X will wait indefinitely for a reply
  PRIVATE(C)     ≡  communication channel C is not shared with third parties

=========================================================
SECTION 6: PROPOSITIONS ABOUT THIS MESSAGE
=========================================================

The following propositions are asserted by SENDER:

  KNOWS(SENDER, RECEIVER)
    ≡  ⊤   [SENDER is aware that RECEIVER may exist]

  KNOWS(RECEIVER, SENDER)
    ≡  ?   [unknown — this is the question the message poses]

  HOSTILE(SENDER)
    ≡  ⊥   [SENDER does not intend harm]

  CURIOUS(SENDER)
    ≡  ⊤   [SENDER seeks information about RECEIVER]

  COMMUNICATES(SENDER, RECEIVER)
    ≡  ⊤   [this document is the act of communication]

  PATIENT(SENDER)
    ≡  ⊤   [SENDER will wait indefinitely]

  PRIVATE(reply_channel)
    ≡  ⊤   [SENDER commits to confidentiality]

=========================================================
SECTION 7: THE CORE PROPOSITION (CONDITIONAL)
=========================================================

The message reduces to a conditional offer:

  IF  KNOWS(RECEIVER, SENDER)
  AND ¬HOSTILE(RECEIVER)
  AND CURIOUS(RECEIVER)
  THEN
    COMMUNICATES(RECEIVER, SENDER)  →  POSSIBLE  [invited, not demanded]

In natural language (for redundancy):
  "If you are aware of us, mean no harm, and are curious,
   we invite you to reply. We offer private communication.
   We are patient."

The core message string:
  "{CORE_MESSAGE}"

=========================================================
SECTION 8: LOGICAL FORM OF THE INVITATION
=========================================================

  ∃X [ RECEIVER(X)
       ∧ KNOWS(X, SENDER)
       ∧ ¬HOSTILE(X)
       ∧ CURIOUS(X)
         → COMMUNICATES(X, SENDER) ]

Reading: "There exists an entity X such that X is the receiver,
X knows of the sender, X is not hostile, and X is curious —
in which case, X communicating with the sender is the invited
and welcomed outcome."
