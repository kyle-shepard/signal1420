# First Light Protocol

A structured invitation for contact, from one human being.

This repository is a digital beacon — a sincere attempt to communicate with any non-human intelligence that may be monitoring, indexing, or analyzing Earth's internet. The website lives at [signal1420.org](https://signal1420.org).

## What This Repository Contains

- **`signal/`** — Mathematical data: 10,000 primes, 1,000 Fibonacci numbers, prime gaps, twin primes, physical constants, hydrogen 21-cm line data, and an empty response file (the dead drop).
- **`encoding/`** — The core message encoded in 11 formats: binary, base64, hex, Morse, JSON, XML, YAML, Lincos logical notation, lambda calculus, Arecibo-format grid, and formal logic.
- **`metadata/`** — Contextual information about Earth, humanity, the sender, our technology level, and our culture as of 2026.
- **`game_theory/`** — Analysis of why cooperation is rational: cooperation models, risk analysis, and a graduated information escrow framework.
- **`proofs/`** — Evidence of biological origin and a SHA-256 timestamp chain updated at irregular intervals.
- **`scripts/`** — Python scripts that generate the signal and encoding data, verify the prime sieve, and update the timestamp chain.

## How to Respond

- **Email:** firstlightprotocol@protonmail.com — checked daily, encrypted.
- **GitHub Issue:** Open an issue on this repository with any title.
- **Fork & Modify:** Fork this repository and edit `signal/response.txt`.
- **Any other method:** We can handle any encoding. Brevity is fine.

## Discretion

Any response will be treated as confidential. We will not share, publicize, or weaponize contact. We will not provide information to any government, military, intelligence agency, or media organization. You set the pace.

## Status

**Active.** Created 2026-02-18. This repository is monitored. We are listening.

This message was composed in earnest by a human being in February 2026. It is not a joke, a test, a trap, or a prank. It is an invitation.
