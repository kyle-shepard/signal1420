FIRST LIGHT PROTOCOL — TIMESTAMP CHAIN
========================================
This file is an irregular cryptographic timestamp chain.

Purpose:
  To demonstrate that a biological intelligence is actively maintaining
  this repository over time. Each entry is made manually (or via a
  scheduled automated job running the update_timestamp.py script).
  The irregular cadence — not perfectly regular, not random — is itself
  a signal of intentionality.

Entry format:
  TIMESTAMP  : ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of when the entry was created
  MESSAGE    : The string that was hashed (human-readable, self-documenting)
  SHA-256    : SHA-256 hash of the MESSAGE string (UTF-8 encoded)

Verification:
  For any entry, you can verify the hash with:
    echo -n "MESSAGE_STRING" | sha256sum
  or in Python:
    import hashlib
    hashlib.sha256("MESSAGE_STRING".encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()

Each entry is independent — this is not a blockchain. There is no
chained dependency between entries. The chain's value is in the
accumulating record of regular updates, not in cryptographic linking.

Anti-cryptography note:
  This file is intentionally maximally transparent. The hash is not
  a secret. The message is not encrypted. The purpose is proof of
  continued human attention, not security.
