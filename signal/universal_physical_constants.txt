FIRST LIGHT PROTOCOL — UNIVERSAL PHYSICAL CONSTANTS
=================================================================
Values from the 2022 CODATA recommended values of the
fundamental physical constants (NIST). These quantities
are universal — any technological civilization capable of
measuring them precisely will obtain the same numbers.
Parenthetical notation: e.g., 6.674 30(15) means the last
two digits have uncertainty ±15 in the stated units.
=================================================================

Name        : Speed of Light in Vacuum
Symbol      : c
Value       : 299 792 458
Uncertainty : exact (defined)
Units       : m s⁻¹
Source      : SI definition (2019 redefinition of SI)
Description : The maximum speed at which information or matter can travel. Defines the relationship between space and time in special relativity. Its exact value is now fixed by definition of the metre.

Name        : Planck Constant
Symbol      : h
Value       : 6.626 070 15 × 10⁻³⁴
Uncertainty : exact (defined)
Units       : J s
Source      : SI definition (2019 redefinition of SI)
Description : The fundamental quantum of action. Relates the energy of a photon to its frequency (E = hν). Its exact value is fixed by the 2019 SI redefinition.

Name        : Gravitational Constant
Symbol      : G
Value       : 6.674 30(15) × 10⁻¹¹
Uncertainty : 2.2 × 10⁻⁵ (relative)
Units       : m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²
Source      : CODATA 2022
Description : The proportionality constant in Newton's law of universal gravitation and Einstein's field equations. The least precisely known fundamental constant — which tells you something about where we are in our understanding of gravity.

Name        : Boltzmann Constant
Symbol      : k_B
Value       : 1.380 649 × 10⁻²³
Uncertainty : exact (defined)
Units       : J K⁻¹
Source      : SI definition (2019 redefinition of SI)
Description : Relates the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas to the thermodynamic temperature of the gas. Links microscopic physics to macroscopic thermodynamics.

Name        : Elementary Charge
Symbol      : e
Value       : 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁹
Uncertainty : exact (defined)
Units       : C
Source      : SI definition (2019 redefinition of SI)
Description : The electric charge carried by a single proton, or the magnitude of the charge carried by a single electron. The fundamental unit of electric charge.

Name        : Fine-Structure Constant
Symbol      : α (alpha)
Value       : 7.297 352 5643(11) × 10⁻³
Uncertainty : 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁰ (relative)
Units       : dimensionless
Source      : CODATA 2022
Description : The coupling constant for electromagnetic interactions. Approximately 1/137. Dimensionless — its value is independent of any unit system, making it a uniquely universal number. Any civilization with a theory of electromagnetism will recognize it.

Name        : Hydrogen 21-cm Line Frequency
Symbol      : ν_HI
Value       : 1 420 405 751.768
Uncertainty : < 0.001 Hz
Units       : Hz
Source      : Essen et al. (1955); confirmed by multiple measurements
Description : The frequency of the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (the spin-flip transition). The most abundant element in the universe radiates at this frequency. Since Cocconi & Morrison (1959), it has been the primary reference frequency for SETI. This repository is named after it.

Name        : Hydrogen 21-cm Line Wavelength
Symbol      : λ_HI
Value       : 21.106 114 054 160
Uncertainty : < 10⁻¹² m
Units       : cm
Source      : Derived from ν_HI and c
Description : The corresponding wavelength of the hydrogen hyperfine transition. λ = c / ν. The '21-centimetre line' is the basis for this project's domain name: signal1420.org.
