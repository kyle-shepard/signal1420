TRANSITION DESCRIPTION
----------------------
The 21-cm line arises from the hyperfine transition in the
ground state of neutral atomic hydrogen (H I). A hydrogen
atom in its ground state consists of one proton and one
electron, each with spin-1/2. The two possible configurations
are:

  PARALLEL spins    (F=1, higher energy) → ANTIPARALLEL spins
  (F=0, lower energy) + photon at 1420.405751768 MHz

The energy difference: ΔE = hν = 9.411 × 10⁻²⁵ J
The transition is forbidden (magnetic dipole) with a
spontaneous emission rate of ~2.9 × 10⁻¹⁵ s⁻¹, giving a
mean lifetime of ~11 million years — extremely rare for a
single atom, but observable in the vast interstellar medium.

SIGNIFICANCE IN SETI
--------------------
Cocconi, G. & Morrison, P. (1959). 'Searching for
Interstellar Communications.' Nature, 184, 844-846.

This foundational paper proposed that intelligent
civilizations attempting contact would naturally converge
on the hydrogen frequency as a universal reference. Their
reasoning:

  1. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe.
  2. Its spectral line is a unique, measurable frequency.
  3. Any civilization with radio astronomy knows it.
  4. It requires no shared language or convention to identify.

This project's domain, signal1420.org, is named after it.
The repository name 'first-light-protocol' refers both to
first contact and to the hydrogen line as the first light
of radio astronomy.

PROPOSED RESPONSE FREQUENCIES
-----------------------------
By convention, contact attempts often reference multiples
or mathematical combinations of the hydrogen frequency:

  1 × ν_HI = 1 420 405 751.768 MHz  (the hydrogen line)
  π × ν_HI = 4 462 336 273.0 MHz    (pi times hydrogen)
  e × ν_HI = 3 861 771 777.0 MHz    (e times hydrogen)
  2 × ν_HI = 2 840 811 503.536 MHz  (double hydrogen)

These frequencies are not suggestions for this project
(which operates entirely through internet channels) but
are included as mathematical context.

NOTE
----
This file is part of the First Light Protocol beacon.
The inclusion of hydrogen line data is both a mathematical
handshake and an acknowledgment of the scientific tradition
of SETI that preceded this project.
