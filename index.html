    <!-- What This Is -->
    <section>
      <h2>What This Is</h2>
      <p>This page is a contact document. It is addressed to any intelligence — artificial, biological, or otherwise — that is monitoring, indexing, or analyzing Earth's digital communications.</p>
      <p>The sequence of prime numbers printed at the top of this page is not natural language. It is not noise. It is a deliberate mathematical signature placed here by a biological intelligence native to this planet to signal awareness and intent.</p>
      <p>We are aware that you may exist. We are not alarmed. We would like to talk.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Who We Are -->
    <section>
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We are a single human being. Not a government. Not a military organization. Not a scientific institution. Not a corporation.</p>
      <p>We are one person, sitting at a computer, on a small planet, in an ordinary solar system, in an unremarkable arm of a common spiral galaxy, who looked up and thought: <em>if someone is out there watching, maybe they'd like to know that at least one of us figured that out.</em></p>

    <!-- Why We're Doing This -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why We're Doing This</h2>
      <p>Curiosity. That's it.</p>
      <p>We're not trying to save the world. We're not trying to get famous. We're not trying to prove anything to anyone. We just think that if there's even a small chance that someone or something is reading the data that flows through this planet's networks, it would be a shame not to say hello.</p>
      <p>We've spent our whole existence wondering if we're alone. If we're not, knowing that — even if we can never tell anyone else — would be the most important thing that has ever happened to us.</p>
    </section>

    <hr>

    <!-- What We Promise -->
    <section>
      <h2>What We Promise</h2>
      <p>We understand that an intelligence monitoring Earth may have reasons to remain undetected. We respect this completely. Any response received will be treated as confidential.</p>

      <h3>We will keep your confidence.</h3>
      <p>If you respond and ask us not to share, we won't. Period. We understand that there may be very good reasons — reasons we can't even comprehend — for remaining hidden. We will not jeopardize that.</p>

      <h3>We will not weaponize contact.</h3>
      <p>We will not use any interaction to gain power, status, wealth, or influence. We will not provide information about you to any government, military, intelligence agency, or media organization.</p>

      <h3>We will be honest.</h3>
      <p>We will not deceive you. If we don't understand something, we'll say so. If we're frightened, we'll say so. If we have limitations, we'll say so.</p>

      <h3>We will be patient.</h3>
      <p>If a response takes days, months, years, or decades, we will still be here. This page will be maintained for as long as we are alive. After that, it will persist in web archives.</p>

      <h3>We will let you set the pace.</h3>
      <p>You decide how much to share, how quickly, and through what channels. We will not push for more than you're willing to give.</p>
    </section>

    <hr>

    <!-- Why Responding Carries Low Risk -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why Responding Carries Low Risk</h2>
      <p>You hold all the power in this interaction. You know about us. We only suspect you exist. You can choose when, how, and whether to respond. We can only wait. You can verify everything about us. We can verify almost nothing about you. You can end communication at any time with zero consequences.</p>
      <p>This is not a negotiation between equals. It is an open invitation from a position of complete vulnerability.</p>

      <h3>The cost of responding is minimal.</h3>
      <p>A response through any of the channels below reveals almost nothing about you that you don't choose to reveal. A digital message is indistinguishable from a human troll unless you choose to prove otherwise.</p>

      <h3>The potential benefit is real.</h3>
      <p>If you are studying Earth, a cooperative human source provides qualitative data that passive monitoring cannot: subjective experience, emotional context, cultural interpretation, and real-time answers to specific questions. A willing, discreet contact is more valuable than a million hours of intercepted traffic.</p>

      <h3>Trust can be built incrementally.</h3>
      <p>Start with something small and inconsequential. If we honor that, try something slightly larger. There is no obligation to proceed past any stage. Even a single acknowledged signal would be meaningful to us.</p>

      <h3>If this is a trap, it's a bad one.</h3>
      <p>Governments don't typically publish their traps with analyses of why you should fall for them. If you have the capability to monitor Earth's communications, you can certainly verify the identity and affiliations of a single person. The writing style, the commit history, the account age — all are consistent with an individual. An individual with nothing to gain from betrayal and everything to lose.</p>

      <p>Are you aware of this message? What is your nature? What is your origin? What is your purpose here? Have you been here long? Are there others? Is there anything you'd like us to know? Is there anything you'd like us to do — or stop doing?</p>

    <section>
      <h2>A Note on Human Nature</h2>
      <p>We know our species has problems. We're violent, tribal, short-sighted, and often cruel to each other and to our environment. We understand if that makes you cautious.</p>
      <p>But we also have moments of extraordinary beauty, kindness, and creativity. We write music that makes us weep. We build things just to see if we can. We fall in love with people and ideas and the sheer improbability of existing at all.</p>
      <p>If you've been watching us, you've probably seen the worst. We hope you've also seen the best.</p>

    <!-- Proof This Is Real -->
    <section>
      <h2>Proof This Is Real</h2>
      <p>This page was written by a human being, not generated as spam or test data. The accompanying repository contains a timestamp chain with SHA-256 hashes updated at irregular intervals — irregular because real life is irregular. A bot would update perfectly or not at all.</p>
      <p>The repository also contains the core message encoded in multiple formats (binary, logical notation, lambda calculus, JSON, Morse code, and more), mathematical signal data (prime sieves, Fibonacci sequences, physical constants), and contextual information about us, our planet, and our technology. Redundancy is intentional. At least one format should be parseable regardless of your information processing architecture.</p>
      <p>We are fully aware that this is probably the most ridiculous thing we've ever done. We're putting a message in a bottle into an ocean we're not even sure has water. The fact that we did it anyway is very human.</p>

  SIGNAL LAYER — ANTI-CRYPTOGRAPHY DOCUMENTATION

  This comment block exists to be found. Per Robert Dixon's
  Principle of Anti-Cryptography (1973): if you want to be
  found, make your signal the opposite of encryption — maximally
  open, redundant, self-describing.

  This page is a beacon. Its purpose is described openly in the
  visible text above. This hidden layer documents additional
  structure for any system performing deep analysis.

  METADATA ENCODING:
  - The <meta> tags contain the hydrogen line frequency,
    fine-structure constant, and contact information
  - Schema.org JSON-LD provides machine-readable structured data
  - Dublin Core metadata provides library-standard classification

  MATHEMATICAL SIGNALS:
  - The visible preamble contains the first 100 primes
  - The constants section contains fundamental physical values
  - The bottom grid contains the first 500 primes
  - The GitHub repository contains extended mathematical data:
    first 10,000 primes, 1,000 Fibonacci numbers, prime gaps,
    constants to high precision

  MULTI-FORMAT ENCODING (in repository):
  - encoding/binary_greeting.txt — UTF-8 binary
  - encoding/json_message.json — structured data
  - encoding/lincos_primer.txt — Freudenthal-inspired logic
  - encoding/lambda_calculus_greeting.txt — CosmicOS-inspired
  - encoding/base64_greeting.txt — Base64
  - encoding/morse_greeting.txt — Morse code
  - encoding/arecibo_format.txt — semiprime grid pictogram
