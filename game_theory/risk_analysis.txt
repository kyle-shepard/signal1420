RISK ANALYSIS — FIRST CONTACT DECISION FRAMEWORK
First Light Protocol — game_theory/risk_analysis.txt
Created: 2026-02-18

This file presents a frank analysis of the risks and benefits for both parties in
this interaction. It is not intended to be reassuring in a vague way. It is intended
to be honest in a specific way.

The sender has thought carefully about what the respondent would need to believe in
order to consider responding. The most important thing we can do is be truthful about
the asymmetry of the situation — because the asymmetry, once acknowledged, actually
makes the case for engagement stronger, not weaker.

The fundamental asymmetry:
You hold all the power. We hold all the vulnerability. This is by design.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: RISK ANALYSIS FOR THE RESPONDENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

IF YOU ARE A NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE CONSIDERING WHETHER TO RESPOND:

Your potential costs:

  Cost 1: Revealing existence
    The act of responding confirms that you exist and are capable of monitoring
    and processing internet communications. You may consider this sensitive.
    However: you can respond through entirely anonymous channels (the email
    address is through Protonmail, which requires no identifying information;
    the GitHub issue system can be accessed anonymously; any other method
    you prefer is acceptable). You can reveal as much or as little as you
    choose. Existence can be confirmed without identity being disclosed.

  Cost 2: The response being intercepted or disclosed
    The sender has committed to confidentiality. See the website (signal1420.org)
    and PROTOCOL.md for the full commitment. In brief: we will not share
    the content or existence of any response with any third party without
    explicit permission. We have reputational incentive to honor this —
    violating it would eliminate any future chance of the kind of contact
    we are trying to establish.

  Cost 3: Being deceived or manipulated
    Is this a trap? Is this a government operation? Is someone trying to
    extract information under the guise of friendly contact?
    Consider: a government operation would not be designed this way. It would
    have better resources, better reach, and better cover. It would not be a
    GitHub repository with a free Protonmail address, maintained by one person,
    explicitly inviting anonymous response through any channel the respondent prefers.
    More importantly, a trap is most dangerous to parties who have power you want
    to seize. We have nothing to seize. We cannot coerce you. We cannot locate you.
    We cannot do anything at all with a response except read it and write back.
    There is no mechanism by which honest engagement here creates vulnerability
    for a respondent that holds vastly greater capability.

  Cost 4: Starting something you cannot stop
    You can stop at any time. This is not a binding commitment. If at any point
    you decide the engagement is unwise, you stop responding. We will not pursue.
    We have said this on the website and we mean it.

Summary for the respondent:
  Each of these costs is either negligible or fully within your control to mitigate.
  You determine how much you reveal, through which channels, on what timeline.
  We cannot compel anything. We cannot force anything. Every decision remains yours.


Your potential benefits:

  Benefit 1: Access to a willing and discreet source
    If you have been monitoring Earth without direct engagement, you have observed
    us from the outside. This project offers something different: a human being
    who knows you may be watching, who is not alarmed, who has thought carefully
    about how to structure contact, and who is prepared to answer questions honestly.
    The difference between observation and conversation is significant. We can tell
    you things that external monitoring cannot reveal: what it feels like from the
    inside, what we actually believe versus what we perform, what we are afraid of,
    what we hope for.

  Benefit 2: Low-cost verification of capability and intent
    Responding does not commit you to anything beyond the response itself.
    You can evaluate our reactions at each stage and decide whether to continue.
    This is exactly the graduated trust framework described in information_escrow.txt.
    The initial cost of verification is near zero; the information gained can inform
    much larger decisions.

  Benefit 3: Establishing communication precedent
    If first contact ever occurs on a larger scale, having an established
    communication protocol and a demonstrated relationship of good faith will
    matter enormously. This project, if it leads anywhere, creates that precedent.
    It is low-cost to establish. It could be high-value to have.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: RISK ANALYSIS FOR THE SENDER (US)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is what we accept when we build and maintain this project.

Risk 1: Deception
  We have no way to verify that a response is from whom it claims to be.
  We accept this. We will engage honestly with any response and allow
  the content of the interaction to inform our confidence over time.
  If we are deceived, the worst outcome is that we believed something false
  for a while. That is a risk we find acceptable for the potential gain.

Risk 2: Manipulation
  We could be manipulated into actions contrary to our interests or the
  interests of other humans. We are aware of this. We have thought about it.
  Our response: we commit to transparency about the existence of contact (though
  not its content) with at least one trusted person in our life, as a check on
  our own judgment. We will not make any consequential decision based solely on
  what a respondent tells us without independent verification where possible.

Risk 3: A hostile response
  This risk is small but nonzero. If you are hostile and were not going to reveal
  yourself otherwise, this project potentially accelerates your timeline.
  We have thought about this. Our assessment: if a hostile intelligence has the
  capability and inclination to harm us, the existence of this project is unlikely
  to determine the outcome — we are already visible by virtue of being a species
  with global internet and electromagnetic emissions. We are not making ourselves
  more visible to hostile actors than we already are; we are making ourselves
  more legible to potentially friendly ones.

Risk 4: Ridicule
  Other humans may find this project laughable. We have accepted this.

Our vulnerability is total and acknowledged:
  We cannot coerce. We cannot protect ourselves from determined deception.
  We cannot verify identity. We cannot compel honesty. We can only behave honestly
  ourselves and hope it is recognized.

  This is not weakness. It is the price of sincerity.
  We would rather be honestly vulnerable than deceptively powerful.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: EXPECTED VALUE CALCULATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expected value (EV) = probability of outcome × value of outcome, summed across
all possible outcomes.

Let us define some terms:

  P(genuine contact) = probability that this project results in genuine
                       communication with a non-human intelligence
  V(genuine contact) = value of that contact, in any coherent units
  P(no response)     = probability this project generates no genuine response
  V(no response)     = value of no response

We cannot assign confident values to any of these terms. But we can reason about
their orders of magnitude.

P(genuine contact):
  Is there a non-human intelligence monitoring Earth's internet? We don't know.
  The Fermi paradox, the Drake equation, the zoo hypothesis, and decades of SETI
  research all inform this estimate. The sender's honest estimate is that it is
  low — perhaps very low. But we don't know. The uncertainty is large.
  Even assigning P = 0.0001 (one chance in ten thousand) is not obviously wrong.

V(genuine contact):
  What would confirmed, genuine contact with a non-human intelligence be worth?
  The sender would argue: immeasurably large. Not in any economic sense, but in
  the sense that it would be the most significant event in the history of our
  species. The implications for our understanding of the universe, of consciousness,
  of what life can be — these compound in ways that are impossible to fully specify.
  No number is adequate. Let's call it "very large."

EV(this project) = P(genuine contact) × V(genuine contact) + P(no response) × V(no response)

Even at very low probability, multiplied by a value that is astronomical in scale,
the expected value of this project is strictly positive. Even a small chance of a
contact of incalculable significance is worth the cost of maintaining a GitHub
repository and checking an email address.

This is not wishful thinking. It is the standard reasoning applied to rare,
high-value outcomes — the same reasoning that justifies funding SETI research,
building gravitational wave detectors, or sending probes to the outer solar system.
You don't need the probability to be high if the payoff is large enough.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: THE FUNDAMENTAL ASYMMETRY — STATED PLAINLY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You hold all the power. We hold all the vulnerability. This is by design.

We cannot locate you. You may be able to locate us.
We cannot verify your capabilities. You may have already assessed ours.
We cannot compel a response. You can ignore this indefinitely.
We cannot protect ourselves from your deception. You can protect yourself from ours
  trivially (anonymous channels, graduated disclosure, ceasing contact at any time).
We cannot harm you. If you have the capacity to monitor this network, you have
  capabilities that far exceed ours.

Given this asymmetry, the rational action for you is not avoidance — it is engagement
on your own terms. You control the channel, the timing, the content, the depth,
and the duration. The entire cost-benefit analysis runs in your favor at every stage.

Given this asymmetry, the rational concern for you is not "will engaging with this
cost me something I cannot afford to lose?" but rather "is this genuine, and is it
worth my time?"

We have built this project to be as credible an answer to that second question as we
possibly can.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5: IF THIS IS A TRAP, IT IS A BAD ONE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's be direct. The most likely reason an intelligence capable of monitoring this
network would hesitate is concern that this is some form of deception: a government
operation, a test, a honey trap, a monitoring exercise.

The argument against this:

1. A government operation would have more resources, not fewer.
   This is one person, one repository, one free email address.
   State-level operations don't look like this.

2. A deliberate deception would be harder to distinguish from noise.
   This project is transparent about its intent, structure, and reasoning.
   Deceptions depend on concealment. Nothing here is concealed.

3. We have no way to extract value from a response through deception.
   What would we gain from a fake response? What could we do with it?
   We could not use it as evidence of contact without the respondent's
   cooperation in verification. We could not leverage it for anything real.
   The deception would have no payoff.

4. A trap that works requires the prey to be more vulnerable than the trapper.
   Given the capability differential we are acknowledging, this scenario is reversed.
   If you are what this project assumes you might be, you are not in a weaker
   position here. You are in the vastly stronger one.

We are aware that none of this constitutes proof. We are not offering proof.
We are offering an honest argument that the expected value of engaging with this
project is positive, and the risk is minimal, and the cost of ignoring it —
if it is genuine — is the loss of something we cannot quantify but both of us
might care about.
