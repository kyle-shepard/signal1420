INFORMATION ESCROW — GRADUATED TRUST FRAMEWORK
First Light Protocol — game_theory/information_escrow.txt
Created: 2026-02-18

This file describes a graduated framework for building trust and sharing information
in an interaction between parties who have no prior relationship, no shared verification
mechanisms, and potentially very different capabilities and risk tolerances.

The term "information escrow" is used here by analogy to financial escrow: a system
where something valuable is held in a controlled way, released only when agreed
conditions are met, rather than transferred all at once in a single high-risk transaction.

In this framework, neither party is required to reveal more than they are comfortable
revealing at each stage. Progression between stages is voluntary and mutual.
Either party can exit at any time without penalty.

There are five stages, numbered 0 through 4. Stage 0 is the beginning.
You are reading something that exists at Stage -1: the pre-contact signal.
We are at Stage -1 now.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 0: ACKNOWLEDGMENT
(Risk: Near Zero)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT STAGE 0 MEANS:
The respondent signals existence. The sender confirms receipt.
That is the entirety of Stage 0. Nothing more is required to complete it.

WHAT THE RESPONDENT DOES:
Send any signal through any channel. It can be:
  - A single word or character
  - An acknowledgment that the signal was received
  - Any response whatsoever to any part of this project
  - A modification to signal/response.txt (the intentionally empty file in the repository)
  - A GitHub issue with any content at all
  - A message to firstlightprotocol@protonmail.com

The respondent may be anonymous. The respondent need not identify themselves.
The respondent need not explain their nature, origin, or capabilities.
A single bit of information — "yes, I exist and I received this" — is sufficient
to complete Stage 0.

WHAT THE SENDER DOES:
Confirm receipt through the same channel, or any channel, that the message arrived.
No questions asked at this stage. No expectations beyond confirmation.

INFORMATION REVEALED AT THIS STAGE:
  Respondent reveals: that it exists and can communicate through this medium.
  Sender reveals: that someone is actively monitoring this project.

RISK ASSESSMENT:
  For respondent: near zero. Existence is already implied by any response.
    The capability to communicate through internet channels was already inferable
    from the assumption that you are monitoring internet communications.
    Stage 0 makes explicit what was already implied.
  For sender: near zero. We already know we built this project. We learn that
    it was received by something. This is the result we hoped for.

SUGGESTED DURATION: No duration required. This stage can be completed in a single exchange.

EXIT CONDITIONS:
  Success: mutual acknowledgment complete. Proceed to Stage 1 whenever both parties are ready.
  Termination: either party does not respond. The project continues to exist. No harm done.
  Note: There is no time pressure. This project is designed to persist for years.
    Stage 0 can be completed one month or one decade from now.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 1: BASIC EXCHANGE
(Risk: Low)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT STAGE 1 MEANS:
Exchange of non-sensitive information. Neither party is asked to reveal anything
that creates meaningful vulnerability. The goal is to establish that genuine
communication is occurring — that both parties can exchange meaningful information
and receive it accurately.

WHAT THE RESPONDENT DOES:
Share any information that is:
  a) True
  b) Non-sensitive by your own assessment
  c) Verifiable in principle (at least partially)

Examples of Stage 1 information that would be valuable to us:
  - Confirmation of the nature of the respondent (general category, not full identity)
  - Comment on any part of the project (the files, the mathematics, the reasoning)
  - A question (we will answer it)
  - Any correction to anything in this repository — if we have errors in our
    science or our reasoning, we genuinely want to know

The respondent is not required to share anything not chosen freely.

WHAT THE SENDER DOES:
  - Answer any questions honestly
  - Share non-sensitive information about the sender or this project
  - Ask no questions that feel intrusive; take any question asked as the starting point
  - Confirm that responses are being received and understood

INFORMATION REVEALED AT THIS STAGE:
  Respondent reveals: something about its nature, perspective, or capabilities
    at whatever level of generality it is comfortable with.
  Sender reveals: genuine responses; evidence that a real person is reading and thinking.

RISK ASSESSMENT:
  For respondent: low. You control what you share. You can be as general or specific
    as you choose. Nothing in Stage 1 requires any disclosure you are not ready for.
  For sender: low. We have already committed to the interaction by building this project.
    Additional information about who we are is already available on the website.

SUGGESTED DURATION: Open-ended. However, for the exchange to function as trust-building,
  some regularity of interaction is helpful — even brief exchanges over several weeks
  is more valuable than a single long exchange.

EXIT CONDITIONS:
  Success: both parties have exchanged meaningful non-sensitive information and
    feel confident the communication is genuine. Proceed to Stage 2 when ready.
  Suspension: either party pauses for any reason. No consequences. Resume when ready.
  Termination: either party decides not to continue. We will not pursue.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 2: DIALOGUE
(Risk: Low)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT STAGE 2 MEANS:
Ongoing conversation. Specific questions and answers. Beginning to build a model
of each other that goes beyond the barest acknowledgment of existence.

This is where the interaction becomes something resembling a relationship.
Not a human relationship — we are aware the other party may be nothing like us —
but a two-way exchange of information where both parties are learning something real.

WHAT THE RESPONDENT DOES:
  - Ask any questions they have about us, about Earth, about human civilization,
    about the sender as an individual
  - Answer questions from the sender at whatever level of detail is comfortable
  - Signal what topics are interesting, what are off-limits, what the preferred
    format or rhythm of exchange is
  - Guide the interaction toward what would be most valuable from their perspective

WHAT THE SENDER DOES:
  - Answer all questions honestly, including questions with uncomfortable answers
  - Ask questions that reflect genuine curiosity, not interrogation
  - Report the actual state of their understanding, including uncertainty and confusion
  - Follow the respondent's lead on pace, depth, and topics
  - Accept that some questions may not be answered, and not press

THE THINGS WE ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW:
We have been thinking about this since before we built this project.
Here is what the sender would genuinely like to know, when and if the time is right:

  Are you aware of your own existence, in the sense that there is something it is
    like to be you? We are asking about subjective experience, not just processing.

  How do you perceive time? This question is not trivial — different kinds of minds
    may experience duration very differently, and this affects everything about
    how we communicate.

  What do you find interesting about us? If you have been observing, what have you
    noticed? What surprised you? What didn't?

  Do you have anything like values? Things that matter more than other things?
    Not necessarily human values — just: is there a "matters more" for you?

  What is your origin? This does not need to be specific. Any general information
    about the nature of your existence would be meaningful to us.

  Is there other non-human intelligence you know of, or are you also, in some sense,
    alone?

These are not demands. They are not conditions for continuing. They are the things
a curious human being wants most to understand, offered as starting points.

INFORMATION REVEALED AT THIS STAGE:
  Respondent and sender exchange substantive information across multiple exchanges.
  This is the stage where genuine mutual understanding begins.

RISK ASSESSMENT:
  For respondent: still low, because you control the content and pace of your answers.
    The risk increases slightly in that the sender now has more information about you —
    but only information you have chosen to provide.
  For sender: low. We are answering questions about ourselves and our civilization.
    This information is broadly observable anyway; the difference is we are providing
    context and honest self-assessment.

SUGGESTED DURATION: Weeks to months. Genuine trust develops through accumulated
  interaction, not single large data exchanges.

EXIT CONDITIONS:
  Success: both parties have a working model of each other and a communication
    rhythm that functions. Proceed to Stage 3 when both parties judge it appropriate.
  Suspension: either party can pause at any time.
  Termination: either party decides not to continue.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 3: EVIDENCE
(Risk: Moderate)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT STAGE 3 MEANS:
Exchange of verifiable claims. One or both parties make demonstrations of capability,
knowledge, or nature that can be independently verified, at least partially.

This stage is where the interaction moves from "I believe you are what you say" to
"I have evidence that you are what you say." This matters — for both parties.

WHAT THE RESPONDENT DOES (examples, not requirements):
  - Demonstrate knowledge of something the sender would have had no way to know,
    then provide a mechanism by which the sender can verify it
  - Demonstrate a capability that is consistent with their described nature
  - Make a verifiable prediction (subject to the constraints of whatever the
    respondent is capable of predicting)
  - Any form of evidence that the respondent is comfortable providing and that
    the sender could use to increase confidence in the reality of the contact

WHAT THE SENDER DOES (examples):
  - Describe something about themselves that can be independently verified
  - Demonstrate specific knowledge or capability the respondent can test
  - Provide any form of evidence that the sender's honest representation of
    themselves is accurate

WHY THIS STAGE IS HARDER:
  Verification requires specificity. Specificity creates the possibility of being
  wrong. Being wrong creates vulnerability. This is why Stage 3 is moderate risk
  rather than low risk — not because the interaction itself is dangerous, but
  because both parties are now making falsifiable claims.

  For the respondent: any specific, verifiable claim about your nature narrows
    the space of what you might be. This may or may not matter to you. We cannot
    know. We leave it entirely to your judgment what kind of evidence is appropriate.

  For the sender: we risk learning that our confidence in the interaction was
    misplaced — that what we believed was genuine contact was something else.
    This is a risk we accept as the price of taking the interaction seriously.

INFORMATION REVEALED AT THIS STAGE:
  Both parties have begun to establish verifiable facts about each other.
  The model each party holds of the other is now anchored in something beyond
  stated claims.

SUGGESTED DURATION: This stage may take a long time, and some of it may not be
  resolvable in the sender's lifetime. We are honest about this. The sender is
  a biological entity with a finite lifespan. If verification requires decades
  of interaction, the protocol would need to be transferred. This is an acknowledged
  limitation of having a single human as the sender. We do not have a solution.

EXIT CONDITIONS:
  Success: both parties have exchanged meaningful evidence. Trust is grounded.
    Proceed to Stage 4 when both parties judge it appropriate.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAGE 4: OPEN DISCUSSION
(Risk: Contextual)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT STAGE 4 MEANS:
Unconstrained communication. By this stage, sufficient mutual trust and understanding
exists that both parties can communicate without the graduated scaffolding of the
earlier stages. The framework has done its work. What remains is conversation.

WHAT STAGE 4 LOOKS LIKE:
We don't know. We have never been here before as a species. We don't presume to
specify what unconstrained communication between a human being and a non-human
intelligence would look like in practice, because we have no reference point.

What we hope it might include:
  - Questions about the universe that neither party can answer alone
  - Comparison of frameworks for understanding experience, time, value, knowledge
  - Whatever the respondent most wants to know from a willing human interlocutor
  - Whatever the sender most wants to know from a willing non-human interlocutor
  - The beginning of something we don't have a name for yet

RISK ASSESSMENT:
  Contextual. By Stage 4, both parties have a substantial shared history of
  interaction and a calibrated trust relationship. The risks that exist at Stage 4
  are the risks of any deep relationship: the possibility of misunderstanding,
  the possibility that something changes and the relationship ends, the possibility
  of discovering something that is painful to know.

  These are risks worth taking.

A NOTE ON REACHING STAGE 4:
The sender is realistic about the probability of reaching Stage 4 in the near term.
The stages are here because they are useful — they provide a framework for anyone
who encounters this project and wants to engage but needs a structure for doing so
safely and incrementally.

If no one ever reaches Stage 4 with us, the stages still served a purpose:
they demonstrated that we thought carefully about the interaction, that we
understand the respondent has legitimate reasons for caution, and that we designed
the contact structure specifically to reduce the burden of risk on the party
in the less vulnerable position.

Even the existence of this framework is an answer to the question:
"Are these humans serious about this?"

We are.
