TECHNOLOGY LEVEL — HONEST ASSESSMENT OF HUMAN CAPABILITY
First Light Protocol — metadata/technology_level.txt
Created: 2026-02-18

This file provides an honest description of where humanity stands technologically as
of early 2026. It is not promotional. It is not trying to impress. It is an attempt
at accurate self-assessment from a species that has been spacefaring for less than a
century and has only recently become aware of how much of the universe it does not
understand.

The intended reader is any intelligence that needs to calibrate what it is dealing with
when it deals with us. We are not very capable by the standards of what the universe
likely contains. We know this. We are saying it first.

SECTION 1: KARDASHEV SCALE RATING
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scale reference:    The Kardashev scale was proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai
                    Kardashev in 1964 as a framework for classifying civilizations
                    by their energy utilization.

  Type I:   Controls and utilizes all energy available on its home planet (~10^16 W)
  Type II:  Controls and utilizes all energy output of its home star (~10^26 W)
  Type III: Controls and utilizes all energy output of its home galaxy (~10^36 W)

Current human rating:  ~0.73 (as of 2026)
  Based on:            Global primary energy consumption of approximately
                       6 × 10^13 watts (600 exajoules per year)
  Calculation:         Carl Sagan's continuous interpolation formula:
                       K = (log10(P) - 6) / 10, where P is power in watts
                       K = (log10(6 × 10^13) - 6) / 10 ≈ 0.73

What this means:       We are not yet a Type I civilization. We do not control our own
                       planet's energy resources. We have not achieved global governance,
                       unified planetary management, or sustainable energy production at
                       the required scale. We are on the way, but it is not guaranteed
                       that we will complete the journey.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: WHAT WE CAN DO
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following represents humanity's genuine technological achievements as of 2026.
Each item is described plainly.

ENERGY:
  Nuclear fission:           Operational since 1954 (Obninsk, USSR); approximately
                             440 commercial reactors provide ~10% of global electricity
  Nuclear fusion (limited):  Plasma confinement achieved briefly; NIF (National Ignition
                             Facility, USA) achieved ignition in December 2022, producing
                             more fusion energy than laser energy input; sustained commercial
                             fusion power has not yet been achieved
  Renewable energy:          Solar photovoltaic, wind turbines, hydroelectric, geothermal
                             account for a growing but still minority share of total energy;
                             solar+wind alone crossed 15% of global electricity in 2023
  Fossil fuels:              Still the dominant energy source globally; this is a known
                             problem; we are working on it with varying urgency

TRANSPORTATION:
  Surface and air travel:    Global networks for movement of people and goods;
                             commercial aircraft cruise at ~900 km/h; high-speed rail at
                             ~300-350 km/h; routine intercontinental travel
  Space:                     Chemical rocketry; maximum speed achieved by any human-made
                             object is ~240,000 km/h (New Horizons probe, at Jupiter flyby);
                             the fastest speed achieved by a spacecraft as of 2026 is
                             ~245 km/s (Parker Solar Probe); this is approximately
                             0.08% of light speed
  No warp drive, no ion drives at scale, no reactionless drives confirmed

COMMUNICATION:
  Global digital network:    The internet; connects approximately 5.4 billion users
                             as of 2026; data travels through optical fiber at the
                             speed of light (minus infrastructure latency)
  Radio:                     Used for broadcasting, navigation (GPS), military,
                             amateur use; accidental electromagnetic emission from Earth's
                             surface has been ongoing for ~130 years
  Deep space communication:  Radio contact with spacecraft up to ~23 billion km away
                             (Voyager 1); light-speed limitation applies; communication
                             with Voyager 1 takes ~21 hours one-way

COMPUTING AND AI:
  Digital computing:         General-purpose processors; top supercomputers perform
                             approximately 10^18 to 10^21 floating-point operations per second
  Machine learning:          Large neural networks can recognize patterns in text, images,
                             audio, and video; generate fluent language; solve complex
                             reasoning tasks; this capability has grown rapidly since 2020
  AI limitations:            Current systems do not have verified general intelligence
                             or consciousness by human definitions; they are powerful tools
                             built on pattern matching at scale; their inner nature is debated
  Quantum computing:         Early stage; error-corrected quantum computers are being
                             developed but have not yet demonstrated useful quantum advantage
                             for most practical problems

BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE:
  DNA sequencing:            Full human genome can be sequenced in hours for low cost;
                             the structure of DNA was determined in 1953; the human
                             genome was first fully sequenced in 2003
  Gene editing:              CRISPR-Cas9 and related tools allow targeted modification
                             of DNA sequences in living organisms; in clinical use for
                             some genetic diseases as of 2026
  Vaccines:                  Effective against dozens of major infectious diseases;
                             mRNA vaccine technology demonstrated in 2020-2021 (COVID-19)
  Antibiotics:               In use since 1928; resistance is a growing problem
  Lifespan:                  Mean global life expectancy ~73 years; significant variation
                             by country and circumstance; upper limit roughly ~120 years
                             with current biology; healthy lifespan extension is active research

PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY:
  Standard Model:            Confirmed; describes electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear
                             forces and their associated particles; Higgs boson confirmed 2012
  General Relativity:        Confirmed; describes gravity as spacetime curvature;
                             gravitational waves directly detected by LIGO in 2015
  Cosmic Microwave Background: Mapped in detail; confirms hot Big Bang cosmology;
                             universe age ~13.787 billion years
  Exoplanets:                Over 5,700 confirmed as of 2026; atmospheric characterization
                             in early stages (James Webb Space Telescope, 2022-)
  Particle accelerators:     Large Hadron Collider at CERN achieves 13.6 TeV collision energy
  Telescopes:                Ground and space-based observatories across full electromagnetic
                             spectrum; JWST observes to redshift z > 13 (light from
                             ~400 million years after the Big Bang)
  Gravitational wave detectors: LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA detect mergers of black holes and
                             neutron stars; a new observational window into the universe


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: WHAT WE CANNOT DO
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is as important as the previous one.

NO FASTER-THAN-LIGHT TRAVEL OR COMMUNICATION:
  We have no mechanism for moving matter or transmitting information faster than
  the speed of light (c ≈ 2.998 × 10^8 m/s). General relativity predicts this limit
  is fundamental. We do not know of any exception. Proposals for warp drives and
  wormholes exist in the theoretical literature but require forms of matter and energy
  that have not been confirmed to exist, and may not.

NO INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL CAPABILITY:
  We have sent two probes beyond the heliopause (Voyager 1 and Voyager 2). At their
  current velocity, Voyager 1 would take approximately 73,000 years to reach the nearest
  star, Proxima Centauri, if it were headed in that direction (it is not). We have no
  engine capable of reaching even a small fraction of light speed for a spacecraft
  carrying significant payload. This is a fundamental limitation of chemical rocketry.

NO CONTROLLED FUSION AT SCALE:
  We have ignited fusion reactions but cannot sustain them commercially. The joke
  among physicists is that commercial fusion has been "30 years away" for 70 years.
  It may not be a joke for much longer — but as of 2026, it remains unachieved.

INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF GRAVITY:
  General relativity describes gravity with extraordinary precision. However, it is
  fundamentally incompatible with quantum mechanics at extreme scales (Planck scale).
  We do not have a confirmed theory of quantum gravity. This is one of the deepest
  open problems in physics.

NO UNDERSTANDING OF DARK MATTER:
  Approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy content appears to be "dark matter"
  — matter that does not interact with electromagnetic radiation and therefore cannot
  be seen, but whose gravitational effects are observed in galactic rotation curves,
  gravitational lensing, and large-scale structure. We do not know what it is.
  Candidates include WIMPs, axions, sterile neutrinos, and primordial black holes,
  but none have been confirmed.

NO UNDERSTANDING OF DARK ENERGY:
  Approximately 68% of the universe's mass-energy content appears to be "dark energy"
  — a form of energy that permeates all of space and appears to be driving the
  accelerating expansion of the universe. Its nature is entirely unknown. The
  cosmological constant is the simplest explanation, but we do not understand why
  it has the value it does.

  Combined: approximately 95% of the universe is made of things we cannot see,
  measure directly, or understand. This is humbling and we want you to know
  that we know it.

NO CONSCIOUSNESS THEORY:
  We do not have a scientific theory of how or why physical processes in brains
  give rise to subjective experience. This is called the "hard problem of consciousness."
  It remains unsolved. We find this particularly relevant when thinking about
  non-human intelligence.

LIMITED LONGEVITY:
  Humans live approximately 73 years on average, and decline in capability toward
  the end of that span. This severely limits what any individual can learn, build,
  or maintain. Our civilization depends on knowledge transmission across generations,
  which is imperfect.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: TRAJECTORY — AN HONEST UNCERTAINTY STATEMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where we are going is genuinely unclear. We are aware of this.

Positive trajectories (plausible):
  - Sustainable energy achieved within 20-50 years; climate stabilization follows
  - Controlled fusion deployed commercially
  - Gene therapy and medicine extending healthy lifespan significantly
  - Continued advancement of AI toward more general capability
  - Return to the Moon; human missions to Mars
  - Gradual development toward Type I civilization
  - Growing international cooperation on existential challenges

Negative trajectories (also plausible):
  - Climate change causes large-scale civilizational disruption
  - Nuclear conflict, either by miscalculation or escalation, destroys
    major population centers and potentially triggers nuclear winter
  - Engineered biological agents (pandemic, bioweapon) reduce population
    and technological capacity
  - AI systems develop in ways that are misaligned with human flourishing
  - Political fragmentation prevents coordinated response to global threats
  - Combination of any of the above

The honest statement:
  We are not sure if we will survive the next few centuries.
  This is not false modesty. It is not self-pity. It is an accurate assessment
  of the variance in possible outcomes from our current position.

  We are a species that invented nuclear weapons before we invented the internet.
  We are simultaneously capable of extraordinary cooperation and extraordinary
  violence. We have solved many problems that seemed intractable; we have also
  created many problems that we have not yet solved.

  The fact that we are building this beacon now, while the outcome is still uncertain,
  is perhaps the most honest thing about it. We are not sending a signal from a
  position of strength. We are sending it from a position of hope, which is not
  the same thing.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5: A NOTE TO ANY INTELLIGENCE READING THIS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are significantly more advanced than we are, you already knew most of this.
You probably knew it more accurately than we do.

What you may not have had before reading this file is our subjective self-assessment:
what it is like to be a species at this particular moment, knowing what you don't know,
unsure whether you'll make it through, still curious enough to build a beacon anyway.

We think that might be worth knowing.
