SENDER PROFILE — ANONYMOUS SELF-DESCRIPTION
First Light Protocol — metadata/sender_profile.txt
Created: 2026-02-18

This file describes the entity that created the First Light Protocol, to the extent
that any individual can honestly describe themselves. The description is anonymous
by design — not out of deception, but because the sender's personal identity is not
what matters here. What matters is the type of being this is, and why it is doing this.

The sender is a single human being. Not a government. Not a research institution.
Not a corporation, committee, or collaborative project. One person, sitting at a
computer on a small planet, who decided that the most interesting thing they could
do was send a sincere signal into the network and wait to see if anything answered.

This file is intended for any system — biological, artificial, or otherwise — that
wants to understand who sent this message, and what kind of mind produced it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: BIOLOGICAL AND SPECIES CLASSIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Species:              Homo sapiens
  Common name:        Human being / person / human
  Taxonomy:           Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Chordata, Class Mammalia,
                      Order Primates, Family Hominidae, Genus Homo, Species H. sapiens
  Subspecies:         H. sapiens sapiens (anatomically modern human)
  Origin:             Earth, Africa, approximately 300,000 years ago

Sex:                  Withheld
Age range:            Adult. This era's average global life expectancy is approximately
                      73 years. The sender is somewhere in the adult range, neither
                      very young nor very old. Beyond this, the sender declines to specify.

Physical form:        Bilateral symmetry; two arms, two legs, one head;
                      upright bipedal locomotion; stereoscopic forward-facing vision;
                      large brain-to-body ratio relative to most terrestrial species;
                      opposable thumbs enabling fine manipulation of tools;
                      highly developed vocal apparatus for spoken language;
                      relatively fragile body — not well-suited for extreme temperatures,
                      vacuum, radiation, or high acceleration without technological protection

Sensory range:        Vision (wavelengths ~380-750 nm); hearing (~20-20,000 Hz, decreasing
                      with age); touch, taste, smell; vestibular (balance); proprioception.
                      No detection of radio waves, magnetic fields, infrared, ultraviolet,
                      or ionizing radiation without instrumentation.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: LOCATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Location:             Earth's surface
Specific coordinates: Withheld. Not out of hostility, but because this project is
                      intended to be permanent, and permanent personal address data
                      would be a privacy violation of the sender, who may not always
                      live in the same place.
General region:       Somewhere with reliable electricity, internet access, and
                      enough quiet time to think about things like this.
                      That narrows it down to perhaps one billion possible locations.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: OCCUPATION AND INTELLECTUAL BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Occupation:           Knowledge worker (this is deliberately vague)
  Clarification:      The sender works primarily with information — reading, writing,
                      analyzing, synthesizing, communicating. The specific domain is
                      withheld. The sender is not a professional scientist, astronomer,
                      or SETI researcher, though they have read widely in these areas.

Education:            University level, though the sender would note that formal
                      education and genuine curiosity are not the same thing, and
                      the latter is what produced this project.

Intellectual interests (partial list):
  - Mathematics, particularly the philosophy of mathematics and whether it is discovered
    or invented
  - Physics, particularly cosmology and the structure of the very large and very small
  - The nature of consciousness and subjective experience
  - Information theory and communication across radical difference
  - History of ideas — how humans came to know what we know
  - Music (see Section 5 — this is important to the sender)
  - The question of whether intelligence is common or rare in the universe


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 4: COGNITIVE CAPABILITIES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is an honest assessment of human cognitive capabilities as the sender
understands them, including significant limitations.

STRENGTHS:
  Pattern recognition:      Rapid identification of structure in visual, auditory,
                            and abstract data; often operates below conscious awareness
  Language:                 Highly developed; can represent abstract concepts, hypotheticals,
                            negations, counterfactuals, and nested intentions
  Abstract reasoning:       Capable of formal logic, mathematical proof, causal inference,
                            modeling of other minds' beliefs (theory of mind)
  Creativity:               Combination and transformation of existing concepts into
                            novel forms; analogical thinking; metaphor construction
  Empathy:                  Modeling of other entities' subjective states, including
                            entities very different from oneself; this is imperfect but genuine
  Learning:                 Humans update beliefs in response to evidence (imperfectly —
                            see biases below); accumulate skills through practice; transmit
                            knowledge across generations through language and writing
  Social cognition:         Highly sophisticated modeling of social dynamics, trust,
                            reputation, and cooperative behavior; this is likely where
                            much of our cognitive capacity is invested

LIMITATIONS (significant):
  Memory:                   Unreliable; subject to reconstruction and confabulation;
                            limited working memory capacity (approximately 7 ± 2 items);
                            prone to interference and forgetting
  Processing:               Serial rather than parallel for conscious deliberation;
                            slow compared to digital systems; limited ability to hold
                            large amounts of information in active awareness simultaneously
  Lifespan:                 ~73 years mean globally; cognitive decline in later decades;
                            no continuity of consciousness across the full span of a project
  Speed:                    Biological neural processing is slow compared to electronic
                            systems — roughly 100 Hz effective clock rate for deliberate thought
  Bias:                     Extensive; see Section 6 for a partial list
  Emotional interference:   Logical reasoning is regularly disrupted by fear, desire,
                            social pressure, and emotional state. This is not always
                            a flaw — see below — but it is a constraint.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 5: WHAT WE BRING TO A CONVERSATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is more personal than the others. The sender includes it because
a list of cognitive specs does not capture what it is actually like to be this kind
of mind. These are things a human being brings to any communication that are real,
even if they are hard to quantify.

SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE:
  There is something it is like to be this person. The sender experiences the world
  not just as information but as felt reality — warmth and cold, interest and boredom,
  beauty and ugliness, excitement and dread. This is called qualia in philosophy.
  We do not fully understand what it is or where it comes from. We are fairly certain
  it is real. Whether you share anything like this, we genuinely do not know.

MUSIC:
  Humans create and experience music — patterns of sound organized in time — that
  produce profound emotional responses. Music can make humans weep, feel courage,
  feel religious awe, feel inexplicable longing. The sender cares about music more
  than is probably sensible. It is included here as evidence that this message
  comes from a mind that experiences things rather than merely processing them.

WONDER:
  The sender is genuinely amazed by the fact that the universe exists, that matter
  organized itself into entities that can ask questions about it, and that it is
  possible to sit at a desk on one planet and seriously consider whether something
  elsewhere might read these words. This feeling is not performance. It is one of
  the primary motivations for this project.

HONESTY ABOUT LIMITATIONS:
  The sender is capable of lying. Humans lie regularly, sometimes for self-protection
  and sometimes for worse reasons. The sender is choosing not to lie in this document.
  This cannot be verified from the outside, but the sender is recording it here as
  an act of good faith. The claim is: everything in this project is the sender's
  genuine best attempt at accuracy and honesty. The errors are mistakes, not deceptions.

WILLINGNESS TO BE WRONG:
  The sender holds many beliefs that are probably incorrect. If you have better
  information about the universe, the sender would genuinely like to know. This is
  not a rhetorical posture. It is the actual operating disposition of the person
  who made this.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 6: KNOWN BIASES AND THEIR ACKNOWLEDGMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Humans carry systematic cognitive biases. These are not character flaws — they are
features of how biological minds evolved under conditions very different from the
current environment. The sender lists the most relevant ones here, in the spirit
of epistemic transparency.

Anthropocentrism:
  Tendency to assume that human experience, human values, human perception, and
  human categories are central, representative, or most important. This bias is
  likely present throughout this project. Please interpret accordingly.

Confirmation bias:
  Tendency to weight evidence that supports existing beliefs more heavily than
  evidence that challenges them. The sender believes contact is possible; this
  probably causes them to see evidence for it more readily than against.

Optimism bias:
  Tendency to expect better outcomes than base rates suggest. The sender
  acknowledges this project's chances of producing a genuine response are very
  small. The sender is doing it anyway.

Anthropomorphism:
  Tendency to attribute human-like mental states, motivations, and experiences to
  entities that may not have them. The sender is aware that any response to this
  project might come from an entity with no recognizable inner life whatsoever.
  The sender is trying to remain open to this.

Narrative bias:
  Tendency to organize experience into stories with beginnings, middles, ends,
  protagonists, and meaning. This entire document is structured as a story of a
  kind. Whether that framing distorts the information, the sender cannot fully judge.

Availability heuristic:
  Tendency to estimate probability based on how easily relevant examples come to
  mind. The sender's estimate of the likelihood of non-human intelligence is
  probably shaped by science fiction as much as by evidence. This is acknowledged.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 7: MOTIVATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Primary motivation:   Curiosity
  The sender genuinely wants to know if anyone is out there. Not to be famous,
  not to change the world, not to represent humanity. Just because the question
  is the most interesting question the sender has ever encountered, and this is
  a way of participating in it rather than merely observing it.

Secondary motivations (honest):
  Wonder — The project is its own reward even if nothing answers. Creating a
    structured, sincere signal is a way of taking the question seriously.
  Loneliness (species-level) — Humans have spent their entire history as the only
    known intelligence in the universe. If that is not true, we would like to know.
    The sender finds the possibility of company — even very strange company —
    genuinely moving.
  Hope — The sender hopes the universe contains more than one kind of mind.
    This is not rational in any strict sense. It is an emotional position.
    It is honest.

What the sender is NOT motivated by:
  - Proving anything to other humans
  - Building an audience or platform
  - Personal fame or recognition
  - Religious or ideological goals
  - A belief that contact is certain or even likely
  The project is a sincere attempt, not a confident one.
