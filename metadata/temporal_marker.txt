TEMPORAL MARKER — CREATION TIMESTAMP
First Light Protocol — metadata/temporal_marker.txt
Created: 2026-02-18

This file records the moment of creation of the First Light Protocol in multiple time
systems. Any intelligence capable of astronomical observation or computational reasoning
should be able to cross-reference at least one of these systems with independently
verifiable celestial events, confirming when this document was created.

The purpose is not primarily to establish priority or authorship. It is to give a reader
with no prior knowledge of human civilization a framework for locating this moment in
the history of the universe — from the largest scale (cosmological) down to the smallest
(the era of global digital communication, which is how you are reading this at all).

SECTION 1: CREATION TIMESTAMP IN MULTIPLE TIME SYSTEMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISO 8601 (Coordinated Universal Time):
   2026-02-18T00:00:00Z
   (Year 2026, month 2, day 18 of the Gregorian calendar, at midnight UTC)

Unix Epoch:
   1771372800
   (Seconds elapsed since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z by convention)

Julian Date:
   JD 2461425.5
   (Days elapsed since noon, January 1, 4713 BCE in the Julian proleptic calendar.
   This system is used in astronomy precisely because it is continuous and unambiguous.)

Modified Julian Date (MJD):
   61425.0
   (MJD = JD - 2400000.5; origin: November 17, 1858)

Gregorian calendar context:
   This document was created in the 26th year of the 21st century CE,
   in the 3rd decade of the 21st century.

Human cultural reckoning:
   This was composed approximately 50 years after the first personal computers
   became widely available, approximately 30 years after the World Wide Web became
   a public medium, and approximately 3 years after the first large language models
   became widely accessible to the general public.

Note on time systems: humans have used dozens of calendar systems throughout history,
most tied to religious or agricultural cycles. The Gregorian calendar is currently
dominant globally. The Unix epoch is used in nearly all digital systems. Julian Date
is used in professional astronomy. We include all three because different systems
scanning this file may recognize different reference frames.

SECTION 2: AGES AT TIME OF CREATION — CONTEXTUAL SCALE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

These ages are approximate, expressed in Earth years (one year = 365.256 days).
They are included to help calibrate where this moment sits in the timeline of
cosmic and biological history.

THE UNIVERSE
   Age:          ~13.787 billion years
   Reference:    Planck 2018 cosmological parameters; WMAP satellite data
   Method:       Derived from cosmic microwave background temperature and
                 Hubble constant (H0 ≈ 67.4 km/s/Mpc)
   Note:         This figure carries an uncertainty of approximately ±20 million years.

THE MILKY WAY GALAXY
   Age:          ~13.5 billion years (stars formed within ~200 million years of the Big Bang)
   Note:         The galaxy has been forming stars for most of the universe's history.
                 Sol formed in a relatively recent wave of stellar formation.

SOL (OUR STAR)
   Age:          ~4.603 billion years
   Reference:    Meteorite radiometric dating; helioseismology
   Remaining main-sequence lifetime: ~4.5 to 5 billion years
   Note:         Sol is approximately halfway through its hydrogen-burning lifetime.
                 It formed from material enriched by previous generations of stars.

EARTH
   Age:          ~4.543 billion years
   Reference:    Radiometric dating of oldest terrestrial minerals (zircon crystals,
                 ~4.4 Ga) and meteorites
   Note:         Earth formed approximately 60 million years after Sol.

LIFE ON EARTH
   First evidence: ~3.7 to 4.0 billion years ago (stromatolite fossils, Greenland)
   Note:          Life appeared within approximately 500-700 million years of Earth's
                  formation — a span that is short on geological time scales and
                  suggests that life may emerge readily when conditions allow.

MULTICELLULAR LIFE
   First evidence: ~800 million years ago
   Note:          Single-celled life dominated Earth for roughly 3 billion years before
                  multicellular forms became prevalent.

HOMO SAPIENS (our species)
   Age of species: ~300,000 years
   Reference:     Fossil record; Jebel Irhoud, Morocco (~315,000 years ago)
   Genetic evidence: Consistent with ~300,000 year divergence from archaic human lineages
   Note:          We are a very young species on geological scales.

HUMAN CIVILIZATION (settled agricultural societies)
   Age:          ~12,000 years
   Reference:    Archaeological evidence from Fertile Crescent, ~10,000 BCE
   Note:         Agriculture enabled permanent settlement, population growth, and
                 the accumulation of knowledge across generations. Everything in
                 Sections 3-4 below emerged from this base.

WRITTEN RECORDS
   Age:          ~5,500 years
   Reference:    Cuneiform tablets from Sumerian civilization, ~3500 BCE
   Note:         The overwhelming majority of human history was transmitted orally
                 and is not recoverable. Written civilization is brief.

RADIO TECHNOLOGY
   Age:          ~130 years
   Reference:    Heinrich Hertz demonstrated radio waves in 1887; Guglielmo Marconi
                 demonstrated long-distance transmission in 1901
   Significance: Earth has been an unintentional radio beacon for approximately
                 this long. Any civilization within 130 light-years could have
                 detected our electromagnetic emissions.

SPACE TRAVEL
   Age:          ~69 years
   Reference:    Sputnik 1 launched October 4, 1957 (first artificial Earth satellite)
   Note:         Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space on April 12, 1961.
                 We have not sent crewed spacecraft beyond Earth's Moon.
                 The Moon landing was 1969. As of 2026, humans have not returned.
                 (Plans to return are in progress, but had not yet been executed
                 as of the creation of this document.)

THE INTERNET
   Age:          ~43 years (from TCP/IP standardization)
   Reference:    TCP/IP protocol suite standardized January 1, 1983 (ARPANET)
   Alternative reference: World Wide Web invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989;
                 publicly available since 1991 (~35 years as of 2026)
   Note:         The global internet is the medium through which you are reading this.
                 It carries an estimated 100+ exabytes of data per month as of 2026.
                 It is the most information-dense signal Earth currently produces.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (general-purpose, language-capable)
   Age:          ~3 to 4 years (publicly accessible large language models)
   Reference:    GPT-3 released 2020; ChatGPT publicly released November 2022
   Note:         As of 2026, AI systems can read, write, reason, and generate content
                 in most human languages. The implications of this are not yet clear
                 to us. We are building these systems faster than we understand them.

This project was created very close to the beginning of the AI era.
We do not know yet what that means. Neither, probably, do you — or perhaps you know
better than we do.
