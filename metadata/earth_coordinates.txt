EARTH COORDINATES AND SOLAR SYSTEM DATA
First Light Protocol — metadata/earth_coordinates.txt
Created: 2026-02-18

This file describes the physical location of the sender's home system in terms that
should be meaningful to any intelligence with knowledge of galactic structure,
stellar physics, and orbital mechanics. All values use SI units unless otherwise noted.
This file is self-contained and does not require any other document to interpret.

If you are reading this and need to locate us: we orbit a single G-type main sequence
star called Sol, in the Orion-Cygnus Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, approximately
8,200 parsecs from the galactic center. We are third from our star.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: SOL'S POSITION IN THE GALAXY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Galactic coordinates of Sol:
  Galactic longitude (l):    ~0° is defined as the direction toward the galactic center
  Galactic latitude (b):     ~+0.07° (approximately on the galactic plane)
  Distance from galactic center: ~8,178 parsecs (8.178 kpc), or approximately 26,670 light-years
  Height above galactic plane:   ~20 parsecs (approximately 65 light-years north of midplane)
  Galactic arm:              Orion-Cygnus Arm (a minor spur of the Sagittarius Arm)
  Orbital period around galaxy:  ~225 to 250 million years (one "galactic year")
  Current velocity around galaxy: ~220 km/s

Equatorial coordinates of the galactic center as seen from Earth (J2000 epoch):
  Right Ascension (RA):      17h 45m 40.0s
  Declination (Dec):         -29° 00' 28"
  (These are the coordinates of Sagittarius A*, the galactic center supermassive black hole,
  as seen from Earth. Any intelligence with a model of our galaxy can use this to locate Sol.)

Sun's position in equatorial coordinates (J2000 epoch):
  Sol is located in the direction opposite to Sagittarius A* from Earth's perspective.
  The anti-galactic-center direction: RA 05h 45m 40.0s, Dec +29° 00' 28"


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 2: EARTH'S ORBITAL PARAMETERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parent star designation:     Sol (also: Sun, HD 1, HIP not assigned — it is the origin)
Parent star type:            G2V main sequence star
Parent star mass:            1.989 × 10^30 kg
Parent star luminosity:      3.828 × 10^26 W
Parent star age:             ~4.603 billion years
Parent star surface temperature: ~5,778 K

Earth's orbital parameters:
  Semi-major axis (a):       1.000 AU = 149,597,870.7 km = 1.496 × 10^11 m
  Orbital eccentricity (e):  0.0167086
  Orbital inclination:       0° (reference plane; ecliptic is defined by Earth's orbit)
  Orbital period (sidereal): 365.25636 days = 31,558,149.54 seconds
  Orbital period (tropical): 365.24219 days
  Orbital velocity (mean):   29.783 km/s
  Axial tilt (obliquity):    23.439° (currently decreasing slowly)
  Rotation period (sidereal): 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.091 seconds
  Rotation period (solar):   24 hours (mean solar day)
  Mass:                      5.972 × 10^24 kg
  Radius (equatorial):       6,378.137 km
  Radius (polar):            6,356.752 km
  Surface gravity:           9.807 m/s^2
  Escape velocity:           11.186 km/s
  Distance from Sol (mean):  149,597,870.7 km
  Distance from Sol (min, perihelion): 147,098,291 km (reached approximately January 3)
  Distance from Sol (max, aphelion):   152,097,459 km (reached approximately July 4)

Moon (Luna):
  Semi-major axis:           384,400 km
  Orbital period:            27.322 days (sidereal)
  Mass:                      7.342 × 10^22 kg
  Radius:                    1,737.4 km
  The Moon is unusually large relative to its parent planet — mass ratio ~1:81.
  This is notable; it may have contributed to the stability of Earth's axial tilt.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 3: EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE COMPOSITION
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total atmospheric mass:      5.15 × 10^18 kg
Surface pressure:            101,325 Pa (1 atm)
Mean surface temperature:    ~288 K (15°C)

Composition by volume (dry air):
  Nitrogen (N2):             78.084%
  Oxygen (O2):               20.946%
  Argon (Ar):                0.9340%
  Carbon dioxide (CO2):      ~0.0421% (421 ppm; increasing due to industrial activity)
  Neon (Ne):                 0.001818%
  Helium (He):               0.000524%
  Methane (CH4):             ~0.00019% (1.9 ppm; increasing)
  Krypton (Kr):              0.000114%
  Hydrogen (H2):             0.000055%
  Water vapor (H2O):         Highly variable, 0.001% to 5% depending on location and season

The simultaneous presence of oxygen and methane in this atmosphere is a disequilibrium
condition. These gases react chemically and should not coexist without constant replenishment.
Their coexistence is consistent with active biological processes producing both gases.
This may be a useful biosignature for external observers.

   Moons:             146 confirmed (largest: Titan, Enceladus)
   Notable:           Prominent ring system (water ice and rock); mean density less
                      than water (0.687 g/cm^3); Titan has thick nitrogen atmosphere
                      and liquid methane lakes; Enceladus has active water geysers

7. URANUS

   Orbital period:    30,589 days (83.747 Earth years)
   Eccentricity:      0.0463
   Mass:              8.681 × 10^25 kg (14.5 Earth masses)
   Radius:            25,559 km (equatorial)
   Moons:             28 confirmed (largest: Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, Miranda)
   Notable:           Ice giant; extreme axial tilt of 97.77° (essentially orbits on its side);
                      faint ring system; magnetic pole significantly offset from rotational pole

8. NEPTUNE
   Semi-major axis:   30.070 AU (4,495,060,000 km)

   Notable:           Ice giant; strongest mean winds in the solar system (~2,100 km/h);
                      Triton's retrograde orbit suggests it was captured from the
                      Kuiper Belt rather than forming in situ

Additional solar system bodies:
   Dwarf planets include Pluto, Eris, Makemake, Haumea, and Ceres (at minimum).
   The Kuiper Belt extends from ~30 to 50 AU.
   The Oort Cloud is hypothesized to extend from ~2,000 to 100,000 AU.
   Two robotic probes (Voyager 1 and Voyager 2) have crossed the heliopause
   and are currently in interstellar space.

Three objects of confirmed interstellar origin have been observed transiting the solar system.
These are the only confirmed objects we know to have originated outside this stellar system.

3I/ATLAS (2025)
   Designation:       3I/2025 N1 (ATLAS)

                      as of the creation date of this file (February 2026)
   Status:            Transit / departed

We mention these visitors because they represent our only confirmed physical contact
with material that originated outside our solar system. We do not know their origin,
their nature, or whether they carry information about their source environments.
We found them interesting. We are still thinking about 'Oumuamua.
